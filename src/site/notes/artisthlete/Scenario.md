The Conversation I

EXT. APPROACHING TO THE RIDGE - DAY

Walking with relaxed and fast pace, we go down to the Woodhouse Ridge. Two stop walking and pick up the text sheet. 

Both sheets are held with each of the twoâ€™s both hands with straight arms. This doubled arm-space distant two of us from each other. 

The conversation starts.

> **The Conversation I** <

VOICE 1
What is the proposition?

VOICE 2
That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?

VOICE 1
Certainly.

VOICE 2
And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?

VOICE 1
True again.

VOICE 2
And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the same remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?

VOICE 1
Very true.

VOICE 2
And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving, art-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who are alone worthy of the name of philosophers.

NARRATOR
End of Conversation I.
